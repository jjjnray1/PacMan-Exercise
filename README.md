# PacMan-Exercise

This project is a simple JS animation of pacman using 4 pictures.

To run just download the files place them all in the same folder and double click or drag the html link into the browser and it should automaticly start moving back and forth.

In the future i would like to update the routing so that pacman can go wherever on the screen instead of just left and right.
